🎯 Component Architecture
TodoApp Component
State Management:

tasks: Array of task objects
inputText: Current input field value
filter: Current filter setting ('all', 'active', 'completed')
sortBy: Current sort setting
error: Validation error messages

Key Functions:

addTask(): Validates and adds new tasks
removeTask(): Deletes tasks by ID
toggleComplete(): Toggles task completion status
getFilteredTasks(): Applies current filter
getSortedTasks(): Applies current sorting

🔧 Customization
Adding New Features
The component is designed to be easily extensible:

Task Categories: Add a category field to task objects
Due Dates: Add date picker and due date functionality
Priority Levels: Add priority field with color coding
Task Search: Add search functionality to filter by text

Styling Modifications
All styles are contained in the styles object at the bottom of the component. You can easily:

Change colors by modifying the color values
Adjust spacing by changing padding/margin values
Modify the layout by updating flexbox properties

No backend integration (data stored locally only)
No user authentication
No task sharing capabilities
Limited to single browser/device
